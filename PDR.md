# Product Requirements Document: YouTube Social App

---

## 1. Vision & Goal

To create a modern, mobile-first Flutter application that reimagines the YouTube experience with a focus on an immersive, vertically-scrolling video feed. The goal is to provide users with a fast, intuitive, and engaging way to discover and watch content from their favorite creators.

## 2. Target Audience

This application is for YouTube viewers who enjoy short-form content and prefer a "lean-back" discovery experience, similar to platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. They value a clean UI, high performance, and seamless navigation.

## 3. Core Features & User Stories

### 3.1. Authentication
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with my Google account so I can access my personalized video feed based on the channels I subscribe to.
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to log out of my account easily.

### 3.2. Home Feed
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to see a full-screen, vertically-scrolling feed of videos when I open the app so I can immediately start discovering content.
- **User Story:** As a user, I want the feed to load more videos automatically as I scroll down so I can have an endless discovery experience.
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear loading indicators while the feed is being fetched and a helpful error message if it fails, with an option to retry.

### 3.3. Video Player
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to tap on any video thumbnail in the app to navigate to a dedicated, full-screen player so I can watch the content without distractions.

### 3.4. Creator Profile
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to view a creator's profile page to see their channel details (avatar, name, subscriber count) and a grid of all their uploaded videos.
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to see a helpful message if a creator's profile cannot be loaded or if they have not yet uploaded any videos.

### 3.5. Explore & Search
- **User Story:** As a user, I want a dedicated section where I can search for specific videos or creators using keywords.
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to see a list of relevant results after performing a search, and a clear message if no results are found.

### 3.6. Navigation
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to easily switch between the main sections of the app (Feed, Explore, Profile) using a persistent bottom navigation bar.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The app must be smooth and responsive, with minimal jank, especially during scrolling and screen transitions. Image and data loading should be optimized.
- **Security:** The YouTube API key and any user authentication tokens must be stored and handled securely.
- **Scalability:** The architecture should be modular (Core/Features) to allow for easy addition of new features in the future.
- **Platform:** The application will be built for both iOS and Android from a single codebase using Flutter.
